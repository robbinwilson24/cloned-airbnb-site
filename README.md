## Full Description: <a name="program-description"/>
This was my first attempt at cloning a real-world website - the Airbnb website. I created this to showcase my ability to create web pages using React.js and CSS. The project also includes components from React-Bootstrap.

This project has limited functionality, but it focuses on the aesthetics and layout of the website. It includes the following features:

- Listing cards displaying various properties with their images, locations, ratings, and prices.
- An upper navigation bar with a search bar and profile section (non-functional)
- A secondary navigation bar with icons to link to the various property types (non-functional - but they do have CSS applied to make them respond to the cursor)
- Footer with links to different sections of the real-world website.

## Future Improvements:<a name="future-improvements"/>
I intend to add more functionality to this page as my coding knowledge develops. 
I aim to add the following :
- A functional search bar with working date selector. 
- A basic user login/authentication.
- Multiple images in the same listing card that the user can click through.
